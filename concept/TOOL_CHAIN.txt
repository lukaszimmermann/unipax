Model generation:
  Starting point was BioPAX-Level3.owl Status: Final, Release v1.0 July 2010 from http://www.biopax.org/specification.php.
  Extension using Protege-4.1beta and merged into one new ontology.
  Translation to an xmi UML file using http://swap.uib.es:8080/owl2xmi/ (Feb 2011 version).
  The UML model was then refined in IBM RSA V.8.0.2.

Code generation:
  C++/Java code stubbs were generated using the IBM RSA transformations.

SQL file generation:
  The UML model was transformed into a logical data model (LDM) with IBM RSA, too.
  The LDM was transformed into physical data models using the IBM IDA7.5.2 tool.

Fixing the following issues with vim (vim *.cpp/h; bufdo: %s/<pattern>/<replacement>/ge | update)
 - *.h: "#include vector" replaced by "#include <vector>"
 - *.h: "vector" replaced by "std::vector"
 - *.cpp: "include """ replaced by "include <>"
 - *.cpp: Inserted namespace "UniPAX::"
 - "java::lang::", "boolean" replaced by appropriate C++ types
